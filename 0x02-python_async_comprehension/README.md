# Python Async Comprehension Project

This project contains exercises related to asynchronous programming in Python. The focus is on understanding and implementing async generators and comprehensions.

## Files

- `0-async_generator.py`: Contains a coroutine `async_generator` that yields random numbers asynchronously.
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: Contains a coroutine `async_comprehension` that collects random numbers using async comprehensions.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measures the runtime of multiple async comprehensions running in parallel.
