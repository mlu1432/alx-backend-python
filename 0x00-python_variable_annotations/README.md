# Python Variable Annotations
# This repository contains various Python scripts that demonstrate the usage of type annotations in Python. The exercises included help reinforce understanding of type annotations and how they can be used to improve code clarity, maintenance, and reliability.

# Directories and Files
__pycache__/: A directory containing Python bytecode files, generated automatically by Python when modules are imported. It's typically ignored in version control systems.

venv/: A virtual environment directory that contains all the dependencies and packages required by the project. It's used to ensure that the project runs in an isolated environment.

.gitignore: A file specifying files and directories that should be ignored by Git. This typically includes __pycache__/, venv/, and other temporary files.

Python Scripts
Each script in the directory serves a specific purpose related to variable annotations:

0-add.py: Contains a function add that takes two floats as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

0-main.py: A script to test 0-add.py.

1-concat.py: Contains a function concat that takes two strings as arguments and returns their concatenation.

1-main.py: A script to test 1-concat.py.

2-floor.py: Contains a function floor that takes a float as an argument and returns the floor of the float as an integer.

2-main.py: A script to test 2-floor.py.

3-to_str.py: Contains a function to_str that takes a float as an argument and returns its string representation.

3-main.py: A script to test 3-to_str.py.

4-define_variables.py: Defines and annotates variables of different types (int, float, bool, str).

4-main.py: A script to test 4-define_variables.py.

5-sum_list.py: Contains a function sum_list that takes a list of floats as an argument and returns their sum as a float.

5-main.py: A script to test 5-sum_list.py.

6-sum_mixed_list.py: Contains a function sum_mixed_list that takes a list of integers and floats as an argument and returns their sum as a float.

6-main.py: A script to test 6-sum_mixed_list.py.

7-to_kv.py: Contains a function to_kv that takes a string and an int/float, and returns a tuple where the first element is the string and the second element is the square of the int/float as a float.

7-main.py: A script to test 7-to_kv.py.

8-make_multiplier.py: Contains a function make_multiplier that takes a float as an argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by the multiplier.

8-main.py: A script to test 8-make_multiplier.py.

9-element_length.py: Contains a function element_length that takes an iterable of sequences and returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains a sequence and its length.

9-main.py: A script to test 9-element_length.py.
